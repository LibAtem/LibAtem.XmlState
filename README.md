# LibAtem.XmlState

This is the library for parsing the XML saved from the Blackmagic Design ATEM software control client

It is written for .Net Core 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and Linux

Note: this is not yet complete, but existing functionality is stable and unlikely to undergo massive changes.

### Device support
This is known to work well with ATEM firmware 7.2, and is likely to work with others.

It has been primarily tested with XML from the ATEM 2ME 4K, with some additional testing against ATEM 1ME and TV Studio HD.
